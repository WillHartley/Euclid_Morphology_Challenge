Material to run SE++ on multiband branch of the EMC.

We processed the EMC using the latest version of the code by Jan 22nd 2022. Beware that results may vastly differ with newest versions! See Euclid paper for details.

This directory contains julia scripts that can be run to prepare the input images of the challenge. Very little was done compared to native_pixels case. We only applied a rough rescaling to the rms maps to account for noise correlations (scaling rms by sqrt(Number of pixels a native pixel is split into). Not doing so would have been "morally" wrong!


Users should first run adapt the path in setup.sh to match their own local download.

- then, run `./coms.sh` shell script. Here again, Nth sets the number of threads over which calculations are run... Edit before as you see fit.

After a few hours, it's done!

- users might want to look at the Catalog_MatchCompare.jl script to explore the output catalogue and compare it with the ground truth available on a subset of the simulated field (more standard julia packages require installation).
